# Python Environment Fix Summary

## ✅ Problem Resolved: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pytest'

### Issue Analysis

The error occurred because:

1. Your Jupyter notebook/Python environment was not using the virtual environment
2. The development dependencies (including pytest) were not installed
3. The Python kernel was pointing to the system Python instead of the virtual environment

### Actions Taken

#### 1. Environment Configuration

- ✅ Activated the virtual environment: `.venv/bin/activate.csh`
- ✅ Confirmed virtual environment Python path: `/Users/jenineferderas/Commercial-View/.venv/bin/python`

#### 2. Dependencies Installation

Installed all required development packages:

- ✅ `pytest>=7.0.0` (installed version: 8.4.2)
- ✅ `pytest-cov>=4.0.0` (installed version: 7.0.0)
- ✅ `pytest-xdist>=3.0.0` (installed version: 3.8.0)
- ✅ `pandas` (updated to version: 2.3.3)
- ✅ `numpy` (updated to version: 2.3.3)
- ✅ `matplotlib` (version: 3.10.6)
- ✅ Additional dev tools: `black`, `isort`, `flake8`, `pylint`, `mypy`, etc.

#### 3. Environment Verification

```bash
## Virtual environment is active:
(.venv) [MacBook-Pro-2:~/Commercial-View] jenineferderas%

## All imports working:
✅ pytest: 8.4.2
✅ pandas: 2.3.3  
✅ numpy: 2.3.3
```

### Next Steps for Jupyter Notebooks

#### Option 1: Restart Notebook Kernel

1. In VS Code, open your notebook
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
3. Type "Python: Select Interpreter"
4. Choose: `/Users/jenineferderas/Commercial-View/.venv/bin/python`

#### Option 2: Activate Environment in Terminal

```bash
## For tcsh shell (your current shell):
source .venv/bin/activate.csh

## Verify activation:
which python
## Should show: /Users/jenineferderas/Commercial-View/.venv/bin/python
```

#### Option 3: Launch Jupyter from Virtual Environment

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate.csh
jupyter notebook
## or
jupyter lab
```

### Testing the Fix

You can now successfully run:

```python
import pytest
from pathlib import Path
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import asyncio
import aiohttp
import time
import json
```
