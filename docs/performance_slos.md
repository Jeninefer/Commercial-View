# Performance SLOs (Service Level Objectives)

## Overview
This document defines the expected performance characteristics and SLOs for the Commercial-View analytics system.

## Portfolio Size Expectations

### Current Production Load
- **Small portfolios**: < 10,000 loans
  - Expected processing time: < 5 minutes
  - Memory requirement: < 2GB
  - No chunking required

- **Medium portfolios**: 10,000 - 100,000 loans
  - Expected processing time: < 15 minutes
  - Memory requirement: 2-8GB
  - Chunking recommended: 10,000 records per chunk

- **Large portfolios**: 100,000 - 1,000,000 loans
  - Expected processing time: < 60 minutes
  - Memory requirement: 8-16GB
  - Chunking required: 10,000 records per chunk
  - Parallel processing enabled

- **Extra-large portfolios**: > 1,000,000 loans
  - Expected processing time: < 2 hours* 
  - Memory requirement: 16-32GB
  - Chunking required: 5,000 records per chunk
  - Parallel processing enabled
  - Consider distributed processing
  - *Actual processing time may vary significantly depending on hardware specifications (e.g., CPU cores, RAM, disk speed) and the degree of parallel or distributed processing and code optimization. On standard hardware, processing may take longer (e.g., 2-4+ hours). Estimates assume high-performance, well-optimized environments.
## Memory Management

### Chunking Strategy
```yaml
chunking:
  enabled: true
  default_chunk_size: 10000
  adaptive_chunking: true  # Adjust based on available memory
  
memory_thresholds:
  warning_threshold_percent: 75
  critical_threshold_percent: 90
  enable_memory_monitoring: true
```

### Memory Optimization Techniques
1. **Lazy loading**: Load data in chunks as needed
2. **Garbage collection**: Force GC after processing each chunk
3. **Data type optimization**: Use appropriate dtypes (int32 vs int64, category types)
4. **Streaming**: Process data in streaming mode for very large datasets

## Processing SLOs

### DPD Calculation
- **Target latency**: < 1 second per 1,000 loans
- **Maximum latency**: < 5 seconds per 1,000 loans
- **Availability**: 99.9%

### Bucketing and Classification
- **Target latency**: < 0.5 seconds per 1,000 loans
- **Maximum latency**: < 2 seconds per 1,000 loans

### KPI Generation
- **Target latency**: < 5 seconds for complete KPI suite
- **Maximum latency**: < 30 seconds for complete KPI suite

### Export Operations
- **CSV exports**: < 10 seconds per 100,000 rows
- **JSON exports**: < 30 seconds per 100,000 rows
- **Parquet exports**: < 5 seconds per 100,000 rows

## Scalability Targets

### Horizontal Scaling
- Support for distributed processing across multiple nodes
- Linear scalability up to 10 nodes
- Efficient data partitioning strategy

### Vertical Scaling
- Efficient use of multi-core processors
- Support for up to 32 CPU cores
- Memory-efficient algorithms for large datasets

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Processing time**: Total time from data load to export
2. **Memory usage**: Peak memory consumption
3. **CPU utilization**: Average and peak CPU usage
4. **I/O throughput**: Read/write speeds for data operations
5. **Error rates**: Processing errors per 1,000 records

### Monitoring Tools
- Application performance monitoring (APM)
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Alert thresholds for SLO violations

## Performance Tuning Guidelines

### Database Query Optimization
- Use indexed columns for filtering
- Limit result sets with pagination
- Use connection pooling
- Implement query result caching

### Data Processing Optimization
- Vectorized operations (NumPy, Pandas)
- Avoid row-by-row iteration
- Use appropriate data structures
- Minimize data copying

### Export Optimization
- Batch writing for large exports
- Parallel export workers
- Compression for large files
- Incremental exports when possible

## Benchmarking

### Test Scenarios
1. **Baseline test**: 50,000 loan portfolio
2. **Stress test**: 500,000 loan portfolio
3. **Load test**: Concurrent processing of multiple portfolios
4. **Endurance test**: 24-hour continuous processing

### Performance Regression Testing
- Automated benchmarks in CI/CD pipeline
- Track performance metrics over time
- Alert on >10% performance degradation
- Regular performance review meetings

## SLO Review and Updates

### Review Frequency
- Monthly review of actual performance vs SLOs
- Quarterly adjustment of SLOs based on trends
- Annual comprehensive review

### Escalation Path
1. Warning: SLO miss < 5%
2. Minor incident: SLO miss 5-15%
3. Major incident: SLO miss > 15% or critical function failure
