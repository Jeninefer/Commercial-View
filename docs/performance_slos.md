## Environment Setup and Dependency Resolution

### Python Environment Issues (Resolved)

Your system is experiencing Python path and dependency issues. Here's the complete resolution:

#### **Issue Diagnosis**

- `python: Command not found` - Python not in PATH
- `pip: No match` - pip command not available in shell
- Virtual environment creation failing due to permission/path issues
- Dependencies not installed (pandas, fastapi, uvicorn)

#### **Complete Environment Resolution**

**Step 1: Fix Python PATH and Dependencies**

```bash
# Find your Python installation
which python3
# Expected: /usr/bin/python3 or /opt/homebrew/bin/python3

# Check if pip3 is available
which pip3
# If not found, install it
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python3 get-pip.py

# Create proper virtual environment with full path
/usr/bin/python3 -m venv .venv --system-site-packages

# Activate virtual environment (use full path)
source .venv/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip in virtual environment
.venv/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Install all dependencies for your Abaco integration
.venv/bin/python -m pip install fastapi uvicorn pandas numpy pyyaml requests pytest
```

**Step 2: Create Requirements File**

```bash
# Create requirements.txt with exact dependencies for your system
cat > requirements.txt << 'EOF'
fastapi>=0.68.0
uvicorn[standard]>=0.15.0
pandas>=1.5.0
numpy>=1.21.0
pyyaml>=6.0
requests>=2.28.0
pytest>=7.0.0
python-multipart>=0.0.5
EOF

# Install from requirements
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 3: Fix Script Permissions**

```bash
# Make all shell scripts executable
chmod +x start_api.sh
chmod +x run_tests.sh
chmod +x execute_resolution.sh
chmod +x server_control.py

# Verify permissions
ls -la *.sh *.py
```

#### **Alternative Setup Methods**

**Method 1: Using System Python Directly**

```bash
# Use system Python if virtual environment fails
/usr/bin/python3 -m pip install --user fastapi uvicorn pandas numpy

# Run with system Python
/usr/bin/python3 run.py
/usr/bin/python3 server_control.py
```

**Method 2: Using Homebrew Python (if available)**

```bash
# If you have Homebrew Python
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 -m pip install fastapi uvicorn pandas numpy

# Run with Homebrew Python
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 run.py
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 server_control.py
```

### Production Environment Validation

#### **Environment Test Script**

```bash
# Test complete environment setup
.venv/bin/python -c "
print('🔍 Testing Abaco integration environment...')

# Test core imports
try:
    import fastapi
    import uvicorn
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import json
    import yaml
    print('✅ All core dependencies available')
except ImportError as e:
    print(f'❌ Missing dependency: {e}')
    exit(1)

# Test Abaco schema access
from pathlib import Path
schema_path = Path('/Users/jenineferderas/Downloads/abaco_schema_autodetected.json')
if schema_path.exists():
    with open(schema_path) as f:
        schema = json.load(f)

    total_records = schema['notes']['abaco_integration']['total_records']
    exposure = schema['notes']['abaco_integration']['financial_summary']['total_loan_exposure_usd']
    print(f'✅ Schema loaded: {total_records:,} records')
    print(f'✅ Portfolio: \${exposure:,.2f} USD')
else:
    print('⚠️  Schema file not found')

print('🎉 Environment ready for your Abaco integration!')
"
```

### Enhanced Server Control with Environment Validation

Your `server_control.py` now includes automatic environment detection:

```bash
# Enhanced server startup with environment validation
.venv/bin/python server_control.py

# Features added:
# ✅ Automatic Python path detection
# ✅ Virtual environment validation
# ✅ Dependency checking before startup
# ✅ Schema validation with your 48,853 records
# ✅ Error handling with actionable suggestions
```

### Fixed Operational Commands

#### **Working Command Sequence**

```bash
# 1. Environment setup (run once)
/usr/bin/python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
.venv/bin/python -m pip install fastapi uvicorn pandas numpy pyyaml requests

# 2. Make scripts executable
chmod +x *.sh server_control.py

# 3. Validate your schema integration
.venv/bin/python setup.py

# 4. Run comprehensive tests
./run_tests.sh

# 5. Start API server with your Abaco data
.venv/bin/python server_control.py

# 6. Process your complete portfolio
./execute_resolution.sh
```

#### **Alternative Commands (if virtual environment fails)**

```bash
# Use system Python directly
/usr/bin/python3 -m pip install --user fastapi uvicorn pandas numpy

# Run server with system Python
/usr/bin/python3 server_control.py

# Run tests with system Python
/usr/bin/python3 -c "
# Manual test execution
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'src')
from data_loader import ABACO_RECORDS_EXPECTED
print(f'✅ Ready for {ABACO_RECORDS_EXPECTED:,} records')
"
```
