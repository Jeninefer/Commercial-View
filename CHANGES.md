# Field Detection Updates - Summary

## Problem Statement
The PaymentProcessor._detect_field method needed to recognize additional column name variations present in the datasets for loan IDs, dates, and amounts.

## Changes Made

### 1. SCHEDULE_DATE_PATTERNS
**Added:** `r'payment[_\s]*date'` pattern

**Purpose:** To match "Payment Date" (with a space) since the schedule uses this as the due date column.

**Example matches:**
- "Payment Date"
- "payment date"
- "PAYMENT DATE"
- "payment_date"

### 2. SCHEDULE_AMOUNT_PATTERNS
**Added:** `r'total[_\s]*payment'` pattern

**Purpose:** To capture "Total Payment" as the total installment amount due, with support for both space and underscore separators.

**Example matches:**
- "Total Payment"
- "total payment"
- "TOTAL PAYMENT"
- "total_payment"

### 3. PAYMENT_AMOUNT_PATTERNS
**Added:** `r'total[_\s]*payment'` pattern

**Purpose:** To match "True Total Payment" for the paid amount in actual payments files.

**Example matches:**
- "True Total Payment"
- "total payment"
- "TOTAL_PAYMENT"
- "total_payment"

## Pattern Matching Features

All patterns support:
- **Case-insensitive matching**: Works with any case combination
- **Flexible separators**: Matches both spaces and underscores using `[_\s]*`
- **Partial matching**: Uses regex search to find patterns within column names

## Files Created

1. **payment_logic.py** - Main implementation with PaymentProcessor class
2. **test_payment_logic.py** - Comprehensive test suite (11 tests, all passing)
3. **demo_field_detection.py** - Demonstration script showing the patterns in action
## Testing

All 11 unit tests pass successfully, verifying:
- Loan ID field detection
- Schedule date field detection (including new "Payment Date" pattern)
- Schedule amount field detection (including new "Total Payment" patterns)
- Payment date field detection
- Payment amount field detection (including new "Total Payment" patterns)
- Case-insensitive matching
- Mixed separator styles (spaces and underscores)
- Null handling when no match is found

## Usage Example

```python
from payment_logic import PaymentProcessor

processor = PaymentProcessor()

# Schedule dataset
schedule_columns = ['Loan ID', 'Payment Date', 'Total Payment']
loan_id = processor.detect_loan_id_field(schedule_columns)  # Returns: 'Loan ID'
date = processor.detect_schedule_date_field(schedule_columns)  # Returns: 'Payment Date'
amount = processor.detect_schedule_amount_field(schedule_columns)  # Returns: 'Total Payment'

# Payment dataset
payment_columns = ['Loan ID', 'True Payment Date', 'True Total Payment']
loan_id = processor.detect_loan_id_field(payment_columns)  # Returns: 'Loan ID'
date = processor.detect_payment_date_field(payment_columns)  # Returns: 'True Payment Date'
amount = processor.detect_payment_amount_field(payment_columns)  # Returns: 'True Total Payment'
```

## Validation

Run the tests:
```bash
python -m unittest test_payment_logic.py -v
```

Run the demonstration:
```bash
python demo_field_detection.py
```
