# API Change Summary

## Change Implemented

Modified the public API of the `commercial_view` package to remove `create_sample_data` from exports.

### BEFORE
```python
from .comprehensive_kpis import ComprehensiveKPICalculator, KPIConfig, create_sample_data
```

### AFTER
```python
from .comprehensive_kpis import ComprehensiveKPICalculator, KPIConfig
```

## Files Modified

- `commercial_view/__init__.py`: Removed `create_sample_data` from import statement and `__all__` list

## Rationale

The `create_sample_data` function is a utility function for testing purposes and should not be part of the public API. It remains available in the `comprehensive_kpis` module for internal use.

## Impact

- **Public API**: Only `ComprehensiveKPICalculator` and `KPIConfig` are now exported from `commercial_view`
- **Internal Use**: `create_sample_data` can still be imported directly from `commercial_view.comprehensive_kpis`
- **Breaking Change**: Yes - code that imports `create_sample_data` from `commercial_view` will need to be updated

## Testing

All functionality has been verified:
- ✓ `ComprehensiveKPICalculator` is importable from `commercial_view`
- ✓ `KPIConfig` is importable from `commercial_view`
- ✓ `create_sample_data` is NOT importable from `commercial_view`
- ✓ `create_sample_data` is still available from `commercial_view.comprehensive_kpis`
- ✓ All KPI calculation functionality works as expected
