# **Summary of changes:**

# 1. **Added mock classes** to prevent import errors when Google libraries aren't installed
# 2. **Enhanced dependency checking** with automatic installation option
# 3. **Created installation helper script** for easy dependency management
# 4. **Added requirements file** for Google Drive dependencies
# 5. **Better error handling** with user-friendly prompts
# 6. **Type hints improvements** to satisfy linting

# Now users can:
# - Run `python scripts/install_drive_dependencies.py` to install dependencies
# - Or let the main script offer to install them automatically
# - Or manually install with `pip install -r requirements-drive.txt`
