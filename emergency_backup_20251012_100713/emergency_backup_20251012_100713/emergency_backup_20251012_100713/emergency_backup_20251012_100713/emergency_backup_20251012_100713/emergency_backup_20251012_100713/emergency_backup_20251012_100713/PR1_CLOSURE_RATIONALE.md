# PR #1 Closure Decision

## Context
PR #1 contains a TypeScript/Node.js implementation that conflicts with the current Python-based system.

## Current Status
- Main branch: Python-based system (fully operational)
- PR #1: TypeScript-based system (CI/CD failing, conflicts)

## Decision: Close PR #1

**Rationale:**
1. Different technology stack (TypeScript vs Python)
2. CI/CD pipeline failures 
3. Current Python system is working and production-ready
4. Maintaining two different implementations creates confusion

The Python system provides all needed functionality and is ready for production use.
