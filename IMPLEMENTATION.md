# Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation provides a complete Python package for loan analytics with two primary methods from the problem statement:

1. `calculate_payment_timeline` - Tracks cumulative dues, payments, and gaps over time
2. `calculate_dpd` - Calculates Days Past Due (DPD) for loan default analysis

### Key Features

1. **LoanAnalyzer Class**
   - Configurable `dpd_threshold` (default: 90 days)
   - Three main methods as specified in problem statement

2. **calculate_payment_timeline Method**
   - Standardizes input DataFrames
   - Filters by reference date
   - Aggregates schedule and payment data by loan_id and date
   - Calculates cumulative dues, payments, and gaps
   - Returns timeline DataFrame with all cumulative values

3. **calculate_dpd Method**
   - Uses calculate_payment_timeline for base calculations
   - Identifies last state per loan
   - Finds first arrears date for each loan
   - Calculates days past due from reference date
   - Adds auxiliary dates (last payment, last due)
   - Classifies defaults based on dpd_threshold
   - Includes comprehensive logging
   - Returns DataFrame with 8 required columns

4. **standardize_dataframes Helper Method**
   - Converts date columns to proper date type
   - Ensures numeric types for amount columns
   - Handles errors gracefully with coercion

### Code Matching Problem Statement

The implementation follows the exact logic from the problem statement:

**calculate_payment_timeline:**
- ✓ Standardizes DataFrames first
- ✓ Handles reference_date conversion (None → now(), datetime → date)
- ✓ Filters schedule and payments by reference_date
- ✓ Aggregates by (loan_id, date) with sum()
- ✓ Merges on (loan_id, date) with outer join
- ✓ Fills NaN with 0 for amounts
- ✓ Calculates cumulative_due, cumulative_paid, cumulative_gap

**calculate_dpd:**
- ✓ Standardizes reference_date
- ✓ Calls calculate_payment_timeline
- ✓ Finds last state per loan (idxmax)
- ✓ Identifies first arrears date (gap > 0)
- ✓ Calculates DPD using datetime subtraction
- ✓ Adds auxiliary dates (last_payment_date, last_due_date)
- ✓ Classifies defaults (days_past_due >= dpd_threshold)
- ✓ Clips past_due_amount to non-negative
- ✓ Logs summary statistics
- ✓ Returns exact columns specified

### Testing

All 10 unit tests pass:
- ✓ Initialization with custom/default thresholds
- ✓ DataFrame standardization
- ✓ Payment timeline calculation
- ✓ Payment timeline with datetime reference
- ✓ Payment timeline with default reference
- ✓ DPD calculation
- ✓ Default classification logic
- ✓ DPD with datetime reference
- ✓ Empty DataFrames handling
- ✓ No payments scenario

### Example Output

```
Total loans analyzed: 3
Loans in default: 1
Total past due amount: $5000.00
Average days past due: 79.67

Loan ID: L003
  Past Due Amount: $3000.00
  Days Past Due: 105
  Default Status: YES (> 90 day threshold)
```

### Dependencies

- Python ≥ 3.8
- pandas ≥ 1.3.0
- numpy ≥ 1.20.0

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or install package
pip install -e .
```

### Usage

```python
from commercial_view import LoanAnalyzer
import pandas as pd
from datetime import date

analyzer = LoanAnalyzer(dpd_threshold=90)

# Your schedule and payment DataFrames
timeline = analyzer.calculate_payment_timeline(schedule_df, payments_df, date(2024, 3, 15))
dpd = analyzer.calculate_dpd(schedule_df, payments_df, date(2024, 3, 15))
```

## Verification

✓ All methods from problem statement implemented
✓ All tests passing (10/10)
✓ Example script runs successfully
✓ Documentation complete
✓ Code matches problem statement logic exactly
✓ Proper error handling and type conversions
✓ Logger integration working
✓ Package structure follows Python best practices
