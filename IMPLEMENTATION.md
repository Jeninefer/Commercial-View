# Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation provides a complete pricing enrichment system for loan data, as specified in the problem statement. The system discovers, loads, and matches pricing data from various sources to enrich loan portfolios.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. PricingEnricher Class
Located in `src/pricing_enricher.py`, this is the main class that handles all pricing operations.

#### Methods Implemented:

**`find_pricing_files() -> Dict[str, str]`**
- Discovers pricing files in configured paths
- Classifies files as "recommended_pricing" or "pricing_grid" based on filename patterns
- Returns stable priority ordering (recommended_pricing > pricing_grid)
- Supports: CSV, Parquet, JSON, YAML formats

**`load_pricing_data(pricing_files: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None) -> bool`**
- Loads pricing data from discovered or provided file paths
- Handles multiple formats through `_load_any()` helper
- Returns True if at least one dataset was loaded successfully

**`detect_join_keys(df: pd.DataFrame, pricing_df: pd.DataFrame) -> Tuple[list, list]`**
- Automatically detects matching columns between loan and pricing dataframes
- Supports case-insensitive matching
- Handles column aliases (e.g., client_segment → segment, loan_amount → amount)

**`enrich_loan_data(loan_df, ...) -> pd.DataFrame`**
- Multi-stage enrichment process:
  1. Apply recommended_pricing with exact joins
  2. Fill missing rates with pricing_grid exact joins
  3. Apply band-based matching for ranges (tenor_days, ticket_usd)
  4. Calculate APR-EIR spread with outlier detection (>50pp warning)
  5. Add has_pricing flag

### 2. Helper Function

**`_load_any(path: str) -> pd.DataFrame`**
- Universal loader for multiple file formats
- Supports: CSV, Parquet (.pq, .parquet), JSON, YAML (.yml, .yaml)
- Handles YAML with both nested and flat structures

## Test Coverage

### Test Suite (24 tests, all passing)
- **File Loading Tests**: CSV, Parquet, JSON, YAML (dict & list formats)
- **Discovery Tests**: Empty directory, classification, priority ordering
- **Join Key Detection**: Exact match, case-insensitive, alias mapping
- **Enrichment Tests**: Exact joins, band matching, APR-EIR spread, flags
- **Integration Test**: Full workflow from discovery to enrichment
- **Problem Statement Test**: Validates exact usage pattern

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from src.pricing_enricher import PricingEnricher
import pandas as pd

# Initialize
enricher = PricingEnricher()

# Enrich loans
enriched = enricher.enrich_loan_data(
    loans,
    join_keys=["country", "sector", "risk_band"],
    recommended_rate_col="recommended_rate"
)
```

### Advanced Usage with Band Matching
```python
enriched = enricher.enrich_loan_data(
    loans,
    join_keys=["country", "sector", "risk_band"],
    band_keys={
        "tenor_days": ("tenor_min", "tenor_max"),
        "ticket_usd": ("ticket_min", "ticket_max")
    },
    apr_col_hint="annual_percentage_rate",
    eir_col_hint="effective_interest_rate",
    recommended_rate_col="recommended_rate"
)
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Multi-Stage Enrichment Priority
1. **Recommended Pricing** (highest priority): Applied first via exact joins
2. **Pricing Grid** (fallback): Applied only to rows still missing rates
3. **Band Matching**: Applied after exact joins for range-based matching

### Index Alignment Fix
Special handling for DataFrame index alignment when merging:
- Merge operations reset indices
- Use `.values` with `np.where()` to handle index mismatches
- Preserves original dataframe indices in result

### Column Conflict Resolution
When both pricing sources have the same column (e.g., "recommended_rate"):
- Merge creates suffixed columns ("_pricing")
- Automatically detects and resolves conflicts
- Fills NaN values from suffixed columns back to original columns

### APR-EIR Spread Calculation
- Calculated before pricing enrichment (independent feature)
- Detects APR and EIR columns automatically (case-insensitive)
- Warns when spread exceeds 50 percentage points
- Handles missing pricing data gracefully

## Dependencies

- pandas >= 1.5.0 (DataFrame operations)
- numpy >= 1.23.0 (Numerical operations)
- pyarrow >= 10.0.0 (Parquet support)
- PyYAML >= 6.0 (YAML support)

## Validation

All code has been tested and validated:
- ✅ 24 unit tests passing
- ✅ Integration test passing
- ✅ Problem statement validation passing
- ✅ Example script working correctly

## Next Steps

For production use, consider:
1. Add caching for loaded pricing data
2. Implement parallel processing for large datasets
3. Add data validation and schema checks
4. Create CLI tool for standalone usage
5. Add performance monitoring and metrics
