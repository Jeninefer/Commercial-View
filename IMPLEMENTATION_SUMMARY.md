# Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement Analysis

The problem statement provided a `MetricsRegistry` class with several issues that needed to be fixed:

### Issues Fixed

1. **Missing Imports**
   - Added `from collections import defaultdict`
   - Added `from typing import Dict, Any, Optional`
   - Added `import pandas as pd`
   - Added `import json`
   - Added `import logging` and configured logger

2. **Syntax Error in `get_latest_metrics` Method**
   - Fixed incorrect indentation/structure where there was an `else:` followed by `except Exception:`
   - The correct structure should be `try:` ... `except Exception:`
   - Original problematic code:
     ```python
     try:
         numeric = [float(v) for v in vals]
         out[name] = {...}
     else:
         out[name] = {'count': len(vals), 'latest': vals[-1]}
     except Exception:
         out[name] = {'count': len(vals), 'latest': vals[-1]}
     ```
   - Fixed to:
     ```python
     try:
         numeric = [float(v) for v in vals]
         out[name] = {...}
     except Exception:
         out[name] = {'count': len(vals), 'latest': vals[-1]}
     ```

3. **Misplaced Logger Statement**
   - Moved the logger statement `logger.info("Module 3: Feature Engineering loaded successfully")` to be properly placed at module level after the class definition

## Implementation Details

### Files Created

1. **metrics_registry.py** - Main implementation of the MetricsRegistry class
2. **test_metrics_registry.py** - Comprehensive test suite (16 tests) covering all functionality
3. **example_usage.py** - Demonstration script showing all features
4. **requirements.txt** - Dependencies (pandas)
5. **.gitignore** - Standard Python gitignore to exclude build artifacts
6. **README.md** - Updated with comprehensive documentation

### Features Implemented

The MetricsRegistry class provides:

- **Timer Operations**: Track operation latency with start_timer/end_timer
- **Custom Metrics**: Record any metric with optional metadata
- **Data Quality Metrics**: Automatic quality scoring for pandas DataFrames
- **Rule Tracking**: Record number of validation rules evaluated
- **Metric Retrieval**: Get latest metrics with time-based filtering and statistics
- **Export/Import**: JSON-based persistence
- **Cleanup**: Automatic removal of old metrics

### Testing

All 16 tests pass successfully, covering:
- Initialization and basic operations
- Timer functionality
- Metric recording with and without metadata
- Data quality analysis
- Rules evaluation
- Metric retrieval and filtering
- Export functionality
- Old metric cleanup
- Complete workflow integration

### Validation

- ✅ Python syntax validation passed
- ✅ All 16 unit tests pass
- ✅ Example usage script runs successfully
- ✅ Proper documentation added
- ✅ Code follows Python best practices
