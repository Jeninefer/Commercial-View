## Implementation Details

### FeatureEngineer Class Methods

1. **segment_clients_by_exposure(df, exposure_col, segments)**
   - Segments clients based on outstanding balance
   - Default segments: [10000, 50000, 100000]
   - Creates categorical labels for each segment

2. **classify_dpd_buckets(df, dpd_col)**
   - Classifies days past due into buckets
   - Buckets: Current, 1-30, 31-60, 61-90, 91-180, 180+, Unknown

3. **classify_client_type(df, customer_id_col, loan_count_col, last_active_col)**
   - Classifies clients based on loan count and activity
   - Types: New, Regular, High-Value, Dormant, Inactive

4. **calculate_weighted_metrics(df, metrics, weight_col)**
   - Calculates weighted averages for specified metrics
   - Handles zero weight edge case

5. **calculate_line_utilization(df, credit_line_field, loan_amount_field)**
   - Calculates credit line utilization percentage
   - Handles zero credit line edge case

6. **enrich_master_dataframe(df)**
   - Applies all feature engineering methods
   - Intelligently checks for required columns

### Wrapper Functions

All wrapper functions:
- Accept parameters exactly as specified in problem statement
- Include appropriate assertions
- Use the global `feature_engineer` instance
- Return pandas DataFrames

Special note: `calculate_line_utilization` wrapper intentionally switches parameter order as documented in the problem statement.

## Testing Results

✓ All unit tests pass
✓ All requirements verified
✓ Example usage runs successfully
✓ No errors or warnings

## Compliance

The implementation fully satisfies the problem statement:
- ✓ Global instance created
- ✓ All wrapper functions implemented with correct signatures
- ✓ All assertions in place
- ✓ Parameter order handling as specified
- ✓ All FeatureEngineer methods implemented
