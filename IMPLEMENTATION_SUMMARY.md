# Implementation Summary

## Accurate DPD Calculation - Commercial View

### Problem Solved
The Days Past Due (DPD) calculation was corrected to reflect **current arrears status** rather than historical first occurrence only. The previous flawed approach would calculate DPD from the first time a loan ever went into arrears, which could overstate DPD if the loan was later brought current.

### Solution Implemented

#### Key Algorithm Changes

1. **Cumulative Gap Calculation**
   - Computes each loan's cumulative gap (total due - total paid) as of the reference date
   - Reference date defaults to today if not provided

2. **Current Arrears Period Tracking**
   - Determines the first arrears date **only for the current arrears period**
   - If the loan's cumulative_gap is positive (still in arrears), uses the earliest date where the gap became positive and remained positive
   - If the loan caught up (gap is now zero or negative), it is effectively current

3. **DPD Reset for Current Loans**
   - Sets days_past_due = 0 for any loan that is not currently in arrears (cumulative_gap <= 0)
   - For loans with active arrears (cumulative_gap > 0), calculates days_past_due as the number of days from the first arrears date to the reference date
   - Clipped at zero to avoid negatives

4. **Default Flag Update**
   - Updates is_default flag based on dpd_threshold
   - Retains other metrics for comprehensive portfolio analysis

### Code Structure

```
commercial_view.py          - Main module with LoanPortfolio class
  ├── __init__()           - Initialize with dpd_threshold
  ├── calculate_dpd()      - Main DPD calculation method
  └── _calculate_first_arrears_date()  - Helper for arrears period tracking

test_commercial_view.py    - Comprehensive test suite (11 tests)
example.py                 - Working example demonstrating usage
requirements.txt           - Dependencies (pandas, numpy, pytest)
README.md                  - Full documentation
```

### Test Coverage

All 11 tests pass successfully:

1. ✅ Loan never in arrears → DPD = 0
2. ✅ Loan currently in arrears → correct DPD calculation
3. ✅ Loan caught up after arrears → DPD resets to 0
4. ✅ Default flag threshold → properly enforced
5. ✅ Multiple loans mixed status → accurate results
6. ✅ Partial payment in arrears → correct gap tracking
7. ✅ Reference date defaults to today → working
8. ✅ First arrears date reflects current period → not historical
9. ✅ Custom DPD threshold → configurable
10. ✅ Overpayment → handled correctly
11. ✅ Default rate reduction scenario → ~5% vs ~22% improvement

### Impact

**Before (Flawed Logic):**
- ~22% of loans flagged as default
- Historical arrears incorrectly counted current loans as delinquent
- First arrears date never reset after catching up

**After (Corrected Logic):**
- ~5% of loans flagged as default (more accurate)
- Only current arrears contribute to DPD
- First arrears date represents current delinquency period
- Loans that caught up correctly show DPD = 0

### Key Methods

#### `calculate_dpd(payment_schedule, payments, reference_date=None)`

Returns a DataFrame with:
- `loan_id`: Unique identifier
- `total_due`: Total amount due as of reference date
- `total_paid`: Total amount paid
- `cumulative_gap`: Current arrears (total_due - total_paid)
- `first_arrears_date`: Start of current delinquency period
- `days_past_due`: Days past due (0 if current)
- `past_due_amount`: Amount currently past due
- `is_default`: Boolean flag based on dpd_threshold

### Usage Example

```python
from commercial_view import LoanPortfolio
import pandas as pd

portfolio = LoanPortfolio(dpd_threshold=90)

payment_schedule = pd.DataFrame({
    'loan_id': ['L001', 'L001'],
    'due_date': ['2024-01-01', '2024-02-01'],
    'amount_due': [1000.0, 1000.0]
})

payments = pd.DataFrame({
    'loan_id': ['L001'],
    'payment_date': ['2024-01-01'],
    'amount_paid': [1000.0]
})

results = portfolio.calculate_dpd(
    payment_schedule=payment_schedule,
    payments=payments,
    reference_date='2024-03-15'
)
```

### Files Changed

- `commercial_view.py` (NEW) - Main implementation
- `test_commercial_view.py` (NEW) - Test suite
- `example.py` (NEW) - Usage example
- `requirements.txt` (NEW) - Dependencies
- `README.md` (UPDATED) - Documentation
- `.gitignore` (NEW) - Python artifacts exclusion

All changes are minimal and focused on implementing the accurate DPD calculation logic as specified in the problem statement.
